# Wordle - Moonlit Edition ðŸŒ™

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Wordle game, built with React and TypeScript. The game offers a serene, moonlit-themed user interface that is easy on the eyes and focuses on simplicity without unnecessary distractions.

Features : 
- Simple and Clean UI: The game features a minimalist design with a calming moonlit background, ensuring that players can focus on the gameplay without being overwhelmed by flashy elements.

- Random Word Generation: A random word is selected from a pre-defined list at the start of each game, offering a new challenge every time you play.

- Interactive Gameplay: Players have six attempts to guess the correct five-letter word. Feedback is provided for each guess, indicating whether the letters are correct, present in the word but in the wrong position, or absent from the word.

- Responsive Design: The UI is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

- Reset Functionality: After each game, players can reset and start a new game with a freshly selected word.
