# Wordle Game

## Description

This project is a Wordle game built with React. Users are challenged to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Feedback on guesses is provided through color-coded tiles, indicating whether a letter is:

- In the correct position
- In the word but in the wrong position
- Not in the word at all

## Features

- **Color-Coded Feedback:** Provides visual cues for guess accuracy.
- **Hints:** Allows users to reveal letters from the word.
- **Sound Effects:** Enhances interactions with sound cues.
- **Popup Messages:** Displays game results and other notifications.

## State Management

For this project, state management is handled primarily through:

- **React Hooks:** `useState` and `useEffect` are used for local state management.
- **Props:** Data is passed between components via props.

### Approach

- **Props:** To manage and share data between components.
- **Local State:** Managed within components using Reactâ€™s built-in hooks.

## Future Considerations

As the project scales, consider the following state management solutions:

- **Redux:** A predictable state container for managing complex state interactions and global state.
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management library, offering a lightweight alternative to Redux.
- **React Context API:** For managing global state and passing data through the component tree without prop drilling.
