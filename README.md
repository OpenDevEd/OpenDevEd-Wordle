## Approach Overview

### Component Structure
- **`GameArea`**: The main component where users interact with the game. It manages state, handles user input, and controls game flow.
- **`PastGuesses`**: Displays past guesses and their results. Utilizes `React.memo` to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- **`LettersList`**: A helper component that visualizes each letter in a guess with different colors based on correctness.
- **`Letter`**: A simple class used to model a letter with its corresponding color.

### State Management
- **`useState`**: Manages various pieces of state such as the current word to guess, user input, error states, and past guesses.
- **`useEffect`**: Fetches a random word from an external API when the component mounts.

### Form Handling
- **`handleSubmit`**: Validates the input word against the external API and updates the game state or shows error messages if the input is invalid.
- **`handleChange`**: Updates the input value and checks for invalid characters.

### Navigation and Error Handling
- **`useNavigate`**: Allows for client-side navigation between components without reloading the page.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages using Chakra UI's `useToast` when the input is invalid or already used.

### Styling and Animations
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling and animations, ensuring responsive and visually appealing UI elements.

### Optimization
- **`React.memo`**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of the `PastGuesses` component by memoizing it based on its props.
